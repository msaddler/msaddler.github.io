I am a PhD Candidate in MIT's [Laboratory for Computational Audition](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu) working with Josh McDermott. I first became interested in studying how living things make sense of sound as a [summer student fellow](https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/educate/undergraduate-programs/summer-student-fellowship/) at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and a [MPL intern](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/mpl/mpl-summer-internship-program) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where I studied the acoustic behavior of whales. I received undergraduate degrees in biology, chemistry, and biochemistry from The University of Chicago, where I was also a research assistant in the Epilepsy Lab.
