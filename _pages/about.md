I am a PhD candidate in MITâ€™s [Laboratory for Computational Audition](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu) developing machine learning models of human hearing. I am broadly interested in how our ears and environment shape auditory perception and my research focuses on pitch perception, hearing loss, and audio enhancement via deep learning. I first became interested in the hearing sciences though undergraduate research positions in the field of marine mammal acoustics (namely the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution [Summer Student Fellowship](https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/educate/undergraduate-programs/summer-student-fellowship/) and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography [MPL Internship](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/mpl/mpl-summer-internship-program)). I received undergraduate degrees in biology and chemistry from the University of Chicago, where I was also a research assistant in the Epilepsy Lab.
